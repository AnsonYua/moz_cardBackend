# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Node.js backend for "Revolution and Rebellion", a trading card game where leaders summon characters to compete based on power and combinations rather than direct combat. The game features a unique round-based system where judges award points to the most impressive rosters.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Start production server  
npm start

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test:watch

# Run custom test scenarios
npm run run-test
npm run run-testcase1
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Game Flow
The game follows a specific battle flow managed by `mozGamePlay.js`:
1. **START_REDRAW** - Initial hand management
2. **DRAW_PHASE** - Card drawing 
3. **MAIN_PHASE** - Character/card placement
4. **BATTLE_PHASE** - Power calculation and winner determination
5. **END_PHASE** - Cleanup and next round preparation

### Key Modules

**Game Logic Layer:**
- `src/services/GameLogic.js` - Main game coordinator, handles game creation and flow
- `src/mozGame/mozGamePlay.js` - Core gameplay mechanics and phase management
- `src/mozGame/mozPhaseManager.js` - Game phase state management
- `src/services/CardEffectManager.js` - Card placement validation and effect processing

**Data Management:**
- `src/services/DeckManager.js` - Deck loading and player deck management
- `src/services/CardInfoUtils.js` - Card data utilities and queries
- `src/mozGame/mozDeckHelper.js` - Deck preparation for games
- `src/data/` - JSON files containing card definitions (cards.json, decks.json, etc.)

**API Layer:**
- `src/controllers/gameController.js` - HTTP request handlers
- `src/routes/gameRoutes.js` - Route definitions
- `server.js` - Express server setup with CORS and error handling

### Game Concepts

**Leaders/Summoners:** Each player has 4 leader cards that fight in sequence. Leaders have zone compatibility rules determining which character types can be summoned to their top/left/right zones.

**Character Cards:** Have power values and types/attributes. Must match leader's zone compatibility. Some have special effects or traits.

**Game Zones:** 
- Character zones (top, left, right) - for summoned characters
- Help card zone - for utility cards  
- Special (SP) card zone - for powerful special effects

**Victory:** First team to 50 victory points wins. Points awarded based on power totals and combos.

### Testing Structure

Tests are located in `src/tests/` with Jest configuration. Test scenarios in `src/tests/scenarios/` contain JSON definitions for various game situations. The test system includes setup/teardown scripts and helper utilities.

### Data Files

Game data is stored in JSON format:
- `src/data/cards.json` - Character card definitions
- `src/data/decks.json` - Predefined deck configurations  
- `src/data/summonerCards.json` - Leader/summoner card definitions
- `src/gameData/` - Test scenario data files

When modifying game logic, ensure compatibility with the phase-based system and validate against existing test scenarios.
